# Objective of this project: 

As an auditor, is to analyze the magnitude of each variable to which it can affect the price of
a house in a particular locality.

# Description: 

This project involves analyzing a dataset provided by Terro's Real Estate Agency, containing information about 506 houses in Boston. The dataset includes various features such as crime rate, nitric oxides concentration, average number of rooms, etc., which are believed to affect the price of a house in a particular locality. The goal of the analysis is to understand the magnitude of each variable's impact on house prices and build regression models to predict house prices based on these variables.

# Action:

Utilized Excel's Data Analysis Tool Pack to perform:

. Summary statistics analysis to comprehend the data's characteristics.
. Histogram plotting to visualize the distribution of average house prices (Avg_Price).
. Computation of a covariance matrix to assess variable relationships.
. Creation of a correlation matrix to identify strong positive and negative correlations.

# Results:

. Identified key insights, including significant correlations between variables.
. Built regression models to predict house prices based on independent variables.
. Determined the significance of factors impacting house prices.
. Contributed to data-driven decision-making for pricing strategies.

This project enhanced my proficiency in data analysis, statistical tools, and regression modeling, highlighting my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
